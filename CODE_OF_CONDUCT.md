1. Be Kind and Courteous
We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.

2. No Hate Speech or Bullying
Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.

3. No Selling or Spam
We encourage you to tell us about your triumphs! However, selling, spam, shameless self-promotion, irrelevant promotional links, and promotion for profit are not permitted.

4. Respect Everyone's Privacy
Being part of this group requires mutual trust. Authentic, expressive discussions make groups great, but may also be sensitive and private. What's shared in the group should stay in the group. Posts in a closed group cannot be shared natively, and we ask that you not post screen shots of WOE posts.

5. No Redundant Promotional Posts & Data Disclosure
Links to thought leadership, events, polls, surveys and other resources are permitted within reason, but limited to one post. Be sure to fully disclose how any data collected will be utilized.

6. No Campaign Shaming
Please do not use this group to point out email errors and poor campaign strategies and tactics. Contact brands directly if you want to report a mistake or offer advice.

7. Quality over Quantity
We aren't looking to be the biggest group on Facebook, just the best. We want you to interact, have fun and support each other. If you can't stick by these simple rules, we will remove you.
